# describe me a demo project, based on Spring, in which I can demonstrate atrium, mockk, kotest, kotest property based testing, and kotest assertions

Here's a demo project concept that leverages Spring (with Kotlin), showcasing Atrium, MockK, and various Kotest features—including property-based testing and custom assertions. This setup is ideal for learning and demonstrating modern Kotlin testing practices in a Spring ecosystem.

## Project Concept: **Book Recommendation Service**

**Description:**
A simple RESTful API for recommending books. Features endpoints to add books, get all books, and get a random recommendation based on user preferences.

### Tech Stack:

- **Spring Boot (Kotlin):** Service + REST controller
- **Atrium:** Human-readable assertions
- **Kotest:** Spec styles, assertions, and property-based testing
- **MockK:** Mock dependencies for testing


### Core Functionality

- **Book data model** (data class: `Book`)
- **BookService** (service class, contains business logic)
- **BookRepository** (interface, with mock implementation for tests)
- **BookController** (REST endpoints)
    - `GET /books`
    - `POST /books`
    - `GET /recommendation?genre=xyz`


### Testing Demonstrations

#### 1. **Atrium Assertions**

Use Atrium to assert REST response structures and service results in a clear, idiomatic way.

#### 2. **Kotest for Test Structure**

- **DescribeSpec** or **FunSpec** for readable, expressive test organization.


#### 3. **Kotest Assertions**

Use Kotest's rich matchers (`shouldBe`, `shouldContain`, etc.) for concise, powerful assertions.

#### 4. **Kotest Property-Based Testing**

Generate random valid `Book` instances to test that the service handles any valid data correctly (e.g., for recommendations, always returns a book for any non-empty genre).

#### 5. **MockK Mocks**

Mock the repository layer to control the returned data and test `BookService` in isolation.

## Example Structure

```
src/
 └── main/kotlin/com/example/bookservice/
      ├── Book.kt
      ├── BookService.kt
      ├── BookRepository.kt
      └── BookController.kt
 └── test/kotlin/com/example/bookservice/
      ├── BookServiceTest.kt
      ├── BookControllerTest.kt
      └── property/BookPropertyTest.kt
```


## Sample Usage of Each Tool

- **Atrium:**

```kotlin
expect(book).toBeOfType<Book>()
expect(book.title).toContain("Kotlin")
```

- **MockK:**

```kotlin
val repo = mockk<BookRepository>()
every { repo.findAll() } returns listOf(sampleBook)
```

- **Kotest (Assertions):**

```kotlin
book.title shouldBe "Effective Kotlin"
books shouldContain sampleBook
```

- **Kotest (Property-Based Testing):**

```kotlin
forAll<Book> { book ->
    book.title.isNotBlank()
}
```


## Project Features to Showcase:

- **RESTful design**: Show real integration with HTTP endpoints
- **Dependency injection**: Spring Boot with mocked beans for testing
- **Test-driven coverage**: Use Kotest specs to demonstrate TDD
- **Custom assertions**: Atrium/Kotest assertions for business rules
- **Property-based tests**: Data generation to test edge cases and invariants

This project gives you a **practical, cohesive way to demonstrate all the requested libraries and testing techniques** in a real-world Spring service, with clear separation between business logic, persistence, and HTTP controllers.
